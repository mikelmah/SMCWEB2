                <p>Beethoven was the grandson of Ludwig van Beethoven (1712–1773), a musician from the town of Mechelen
                     in the Austrian Duchy of Brabant (in what is now the Flemish region of Belgium) who had moved to 
                     Bonn at the age of 21. Ludwig was employed as a bass singer at the court of the Elector of 
                     Cologne, eventually rising to become, in 1761, Kapellmeister (music director) and thereafter the 
                     pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life 
                     remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage. Ludwig had one
                     son, Johann (1740–1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard 
                     and violin lessons to supplement his income. Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767; 
                     she was the daughter of Johann Heinrich Keverich (1701–1751), who had been the head chef at the 
                     court of the Archbishopric of Trier.</p>

                <h2>Musical maturation</h2>
                <p>Beethoven composed his first six string quartets (Op. 18) between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and
                     dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz). They were published in 1801. With premieres of his First and 
                     Second Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a 
                     generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. He also continued to write in other 
                     forms, turning out widely known piano sonatas like the "Pathétique" sonata (Op. 13), which Cooper 
                     describes as "surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of 
                     emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation."He also 
                     completed his Septet (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his 
                     lifetime.</p>

                <h2>Loss of hearing</h2>
                <p>Beethoven is reported to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at
                     the interruption of his work—having fallen over, he got up to find himself deaf. His hearing only
                      ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. 
                      As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in 
                      both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already 
                      aware of the problems).</p>

                <h2>The three sections</h2>
                <p>Beethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods. 
                    The "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, 
                    and the "late" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year
                     after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand
                      the development of Beethoven's work.<br>
                    Beethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest
                     known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are 
                     known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790
                      are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's
                       sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790–1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a 
                       number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music
                        (including movements of symphonies and a violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary 
                        chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.<br>
                    The conventional "first period" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the 
                    first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 
                    were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' 
                    (best known today from Haydn and Mozart) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 
                    to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, 
                    for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often 
                    includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic
                     harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an 
                     audience to appreciate.</p>
