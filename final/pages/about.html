                            <p>Reading to Kids is a grassroots organization dedicated to inspiring underserved children with a love of reading, thereby enriching their lives and opportunities for success in the future. 
                                 To this end, Reading to Kids gathers on average 601 children and 322 volunteers at reading clubs on the second Saturday of every month at eight Los Angeles elementary schools.
                                </p>
                            <p>At the monthly reading clubs, pairs of volunteers read aloud to small groups of children, while their parents receive training on how to encourage their children to read at home.  
                                Kids, parents, teachers, and school libraries receive book donations at the end of the reading clubs.  These are important donations, as 60 percent of low-income homes do not have age-appropriate reading materials for children.</p>
